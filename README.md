# aw-watcher-network-location

`aw-watcher-network-location` is a Rust-based watcher for ActivityWatch that periodically sends network location data to an ActivityWatch server.

## Description

This project is designed to monitor network location data and send it to an ActivityWatch server at regular intervals. It scans for the wifi networks in the vicinity and uses the Google Geolocation API to determine the location based on the MAC addresses of the networks.
It is still in early development and is not yet ready for production use.
